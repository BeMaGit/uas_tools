### Low Poly Drone Frame

#### General Shapre

```
An isometric corner view 3D CAD render of a fully built, ultra low-poly FPV drone. The design is constructed from large, chunky facets with a significantly reduced polygon count, creating a sharp, abstract spaceship aesthetic. The color is grey with a subtle 3D printed texture. The frame geometry features front arms extending straight out, perpendicular to the main body, while the rear arms are angled sharply backwards in a "dead cat" configuration. It is a complete build featuring simplified brushless motors with bright red propellers, a small FPV camera integrated into the blocky nose, a geometric LiPo battery strapped to the top deck, and a VTX antenna tail extending from the rear. There is no GoPro or action camera mount. The look is clean, technical, and extremely minimal. The drone is set against a seamless, plain white studio background with bright, even studio lighting that highlights the sharp, simple edges.
